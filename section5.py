# Square Area (E)
## Define a function that calculates the area of a square. For example, if I was to call your function with foo(7) the output would be 49. If I called it with foo(3)  it would return 9, and so on. Note that you don't have to name your function foo. Give it any name you want.
def foo (lado):
    area = lado * lado
    return area
    
print(foo(4))

# Volume Converter (E)
## Define a function that converts fluid ounces to milliliters knowing that 1 fluid ounce is equal to 29.57353 milliliters. For example, I was to call your function with foo(1) I would get an output of 29.57353. If I called it with  foo(5) I would get 147.86765, and so on.
def foo(ml):
    vol = ml * 29.57353
